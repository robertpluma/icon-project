        Parents, teachers, government leaders, and medical professionals are all at odds over how to begin the school year and safely reopen schools amid a pandemic. This confusion makes it difficult for young students to understand why they must
        follow certain protocols, or why they canâ€™t see their friends.

        On top of this, there is a great lack of mental health resources for children who are struggling with isolation and anxiety. An information sheet for children and their parents to begin a conversation around how to continue facing the
        long-term
        impacts of the pandemic may help initiate the process of addressing these problems which many families are struggling with.
